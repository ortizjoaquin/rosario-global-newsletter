        An EU vaccine "passport" has been introduced, enabling holders to prove they have been jabbed.
    </b>
    <p>
        The EU Digital Covid Certificate can be used to avoid self-isolating on arrival in the UK, if travelling from amber-list countries.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What's the EU Digital Covid Certificate?
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is available in all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
        EU citizens (and those of Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), can download it or obtain a paper copy - at no cost. It is also available to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_2781" target="_BLANK">non-EU nationals living legally in member states</a> who have the right to travel to other member states.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons.
    </p>
    <p>
        EU nationals vaccinated in the UK <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_2781" target="_BLANK">must check with their home countries</a> to see if they are eligible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Travellers will still need to carry a passport or other identification.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How does it work?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The certificate <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/eu-digital-covid-certificate/" target="_BLANK">can be issued if someone has:</a>
    </p>
    <li>
        been vaccinated against Covid-19
    </li>
    <li>
        recently had a negative PCR test
    </li>
    <li>
        recently recovered from Covid-19
    </li>
    <p>
        Anyone holding a certificate <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/eu-digital-covid-certificate/" target="_BLANK">should, in principle, be exempted</a> from testing or quarantine when crossing a border within the EU (or Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein).
    </p>

    <p>
        It has a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en#how-can-citizens-get-the-certificate" target="_BLANK">QR code</a> unique to the place an individual's vaccine information is stored - a hospital or test centre, for example. The personal data is not saved locally when it's verified - at an airport, for example.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Can I travel to the UK and use the NHS Covid Pass instead?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/" target="_BLANK">NHS Covid Pass</a> is a similar vaccine "passport", but it is only for people who have been fully vaccinated through the NHS.
    </p>
    <p>
        People in <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/" target="_BLANK">England</a> arriving from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england" target="_BLANK">an amber country</a> can avoid quarantine by using the pass (or by calling 119 for a printed letter).
    </p>
    <li>
        The NHS Covid Pass is available in <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/covid19status" target="_BLANK">Wales</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        People in <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/covid19status" target="_BLANK">Scotland</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Northern Ireland has <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/services/coronavirus-covid-19-covid-certificate-ni-residents" target="_BLANK">a temporary system</a> in place
    </li>
    <h2>
        Can I use the NHS Covid Pass in the EU?
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can't yet use it EU-wide - but some individual countries, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-56997931" target="_BLANK">such as Greece, Malta and Spain,</a> do accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The EU says it's working to ensure its own certificate is compatible with similar products.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it's satisfied the NHS pass complies with EU standards and systems, it can decide to accept it.
