        What's the EU Digital Covid Certificate?
    </h2>

        It is available in all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

        EU citizens (and those of Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), can download it or obtain a paper copy - at no cost. It is also available to non-EU nationals living legally in member states who have the right to travel to other member states.
