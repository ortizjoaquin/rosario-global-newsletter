                     An EU vaccine "passport" has been introduced, enabling holders to prove they have been jabbed.

                    The EU Digital Covid Certificate can be used to avoid self-isolating on arrival in the UK,
                    if travelling from amber-list countries.

                    What's the EU Digital Covid Certificate?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is available in all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EU citizens (and those of Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), can download it or obtain a paper copy - at no cost.
                    It is also available to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_2781" target="_blank">
                    non-EU nationals living legally in member states</a> who have the right to travel to other member states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons.

                    must check with their home countries</a>
                    to see if they are eligible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travellers will still need to carry a passport or other identification.

                    You can't yet use it EU-wide - but some individual countries,
                    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-56997931" target="_blank">such as Greece, Malta and Spain,</a> do accept it.

                    The EU says it's working to ensure its own certificate is compatible with similar products.

                <p>
                    If it's satisfied the NHS pass complies with EU standards and systems, it can decide to accept it.
